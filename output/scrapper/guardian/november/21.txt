California s last nuclear plant could get a new lease on life after the Biden administration announced the approval of up to  1 1bn in conditional funding on Monday  The grant funds may offer a path to keeping the ageing facility known as Diablo Canyon online beyond its scheduled shutdown in 2025 The last nuclear plant in California   and the unexpected quest to save itRead moreTucked against picturesque bluffs along California s central coast  the plant has faced a spate of controversies over the decades  for its impact on underwater ecosystems  the production of toxic waste and its proximity to earthquake fault lines  Its planned closure by 2025 seemed an all but certain step in California s ambitious journey toward a greener future But concerns over the state s ability to generate enough green energy to fill the gap left by the plant s closure grew as the deadline neared  The state is far from finding a reliable and climate conscious replacement for the energy produced by the plant  The largest single source provider in the state generates more than 8  of California s electricity  enough to supply more than 3 million residents  California is facing steep energy challenges that are only expected to worsen as the climate crisis intensifies It s an issue being grappled with in states across the US  The nuclear power industry s 92 reactors generate more than half of the country s virtually carbon free electricity  but about a dozen reactors have closed since 2013 in the face of competition from renewable energy and plants that burn plentiful natural gas As part of its effort to fight the climate crisis  the Biden administration set aside these grant funds to keep struggling nuclear plants online California s governor  Gavin Newsom  has also been among those strongly advocating for extending the life of Diablo Canyon  thereby giving the state more time to complete its ambitious green energy transition  In September  the governor pushed state lawmakers to approve a  1bn loan to keep the facility running an additional five years  The federal funds   the terms of which are still being negotiated   would help cover operating costs and be doled out over the course of four years Diablo Canyon still has obstacles to cross though  most significantly the need for a renewed license from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission  Significant upgrades were needed to ensure the plant could continue to operate safely and sustainably  And there are still vocal critics of any plan to keep it open  The danger of Diablo Canyon is that it is a tempting way of somehow assuming that there s an easy way to avoid responsibility for the next phases of the clean energy transition   said Ralph Cavanagh  the energy co director of the environmental advocacy organization Natural Resources Defense Council s Climate and clean energy program  who helped negotiated the plant s decommission Diablo Canyon supplies 8  of California s electricity  Photograph  Michael Mariant APCritics also highlight how the region is vulnerable to earthquakes and that there is no permanent place for disposing of radioactive nuclear waste Suzanne Hosn  a spokesperson for PG E  the utility company that operates the plant  said Diablo can  safely withstand extreme natural events  including potential earthquakes  tsunamis and flooding  Hosn pointed to analyses performed in 2015 by the NRC after the 2011 crisis at the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan that was slammed by a tsunami  releasing radioactive materials and forcing the evacuation of some 80 000 residents  The NRC said in the 2015 reports that Diablo was safe from tsunamis including ones generated by underwater landslides and earthquakes Calling nuclear the  nation s largest source of clean electricity   US secretary of energy  Jennifer Granholm  said the grant was a  critical step toward ensuring that our domestic nuclear fleet will continue providing reliable and affordable power  Biden has set a goal of decarbonizing the grid by 2035  and the administration is relying on nuclear energy to play a part  The grant is intended to ensure that plants like Diablo Canyon can stay afloat  We can protect these facilities and the communities they serve   Granholm said Reuters contributed reporting to this story
