Tributes have poured in for pilots who were among the six killed when two historic military planes collided in midair during a show in Dallas on Saturday afternoon  with people saying they were heartbroken that the aerialists died while engaging in what they loved The union which represents pilots for Dallas based American Airlines said on Twitter that retirees Len Root and Terry Barker were aboard a B 17 Flying Fortress bomber that crashed with a P 63 Kingcobra fighter during an exhibition involving the two second world war era aircraft  Our hearts go out to their families  friends  and colleagues past and present   read the statement from the Allied Pilots Association union Meanwhile  numerous people identifying themselves as acquaintances of United Airlines pilot Craig Hutain said he was aboard the single seat Kingcobra Authorities as of Sunday morning had not officially identified any of those who were killed during the disaster  which was captured on several videos circulating on social media Yet  as is often the case  people who knew the pilots had already gone online to grieve their unexpected deaths despite a lack of official identification  Len tragically died doing what he loved  flying a warbird in an airshow   read one tribute to Root   To say you will be missed is the world s biggest understatement  my friend  You are loved  and we are all better for having known you  Another recalled Root being as interested in historic race cars as he was in old airplanes  That tribute added that Root was  quiet  yet friendly  no matter how accomplished he was as a commercial pilot  Meanwhile  the mayor of Keller  Texas  described Barker as a former city council member there  The mayor  Armin Mizani  also called Barker a  husband  father   and  Army veteran  who was flying Saturday to honor  the greatest generation   which is how Americans refer to their compatriots who helped defeat the Axis powers during the second world war  Terry Barker was beloved by many   Mizai said   He was a friend and someone whose guidance I often sought  Even after retiring from serving on the city council and flying for American Airlines  his love for community was unmistakable  Hutain  for his part  often flew in a re enactment of the 7 December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor titled  Tora Tora Tora   according to a biography of him available online  In late July  he told the Ohio news station WKEF that pilots like him would  try to create a history lesson  a very entertaining history lesson  whenever they took to the skies for spectators  He said he loved any opportunity to show off the planes to whoever wanted to see them since they were a piece of history   one tribute to Hutain read on Sunday A number of tributes to Root  Barker and Hutain also said men named Curt Rowe and Kevin Michels were killed in Saturday s collision Rowe spent 30 years with the Ohio chapter of the non profit Civil Air Patrol  the agency s commander  Pete Bowden  said in a Facebook post on Sunday His most recent position was as the chapter s maintenance officer  I reach to find solace in that when great aviators like Curt perish  they do so doing what they loved   Bowden s post added   Curt touched the lives of thousands of his fellow  patrol  members  especially the cadets who he flew during orientation flights or taught at flight academies and for that  we should be forever grateful  Michels s name matched that of a man seen in a Facebook video showing off a B 17 at a Wings Over Dallas show three years ago  In the clip  Michels says the bomber s impressive exterior had just been repainted and looked  almost factory fresh   but he then invites viewers inside  which was the plane s  real jewel   You had so much passion for your work and for your relationships   one tribute to Michels read   It was exciting to feel that love every time your presence was near  One tribute which accurately included the names of Root  Barker  Hutain  Rowe and Michels before they were more widely known said Dan Ragan was the sixth dead crew member  A social media video from a prior Wings Over Dallas show suggested Ragan had served on the B 17 that crashed on Saturday back in 1955  when it was part of a navy squad Ragan said he had a brother who was a B 17 pilot  and to be able to fly on the same kind of plane was  beautiful   I was in heaven   Ragan said The B 17 and P 63 were participating in the Wings Over Dallas Show when   according to videos   the fighter crashed into the bomber about 1 20pm on Saturday Both planes quickly fell to the ground and set off a large ball of fire and smoke at the scene of the crash at the Dallas executive airport  about 10 miles  16km  from the city s downtown  No one on the ground was injured The US used the hulking  four engine B 17 in daylight raids against Germany during the second world war  The bomber that crashed during Wings Over Dallas had five people onboard Though US made  the Kingcobra was mostly used by Soviet forces in the second world war Aubrey Anne Young  37  watched the planes collide while her children were inside the hangar with their father  she told the Associated Press  It was really horrific to see   Young  who uploaded a video of the disaster online  added   I m still trying to make sense of it  Staged by an organization known as the Commemorative Air Force  Wings Over Dallas offered guests the chance to see more than 40 aircraft flown during the second world war  The show was scheduled for Veterans Day weekend  which began on Friday A Philadelphia aviation attorney who flew in airshows for 12 years  Arthur Alan Wolk  told the AP that he reviewed Wings Over Dallas video and concluded the P 63 pilot violated the basic rule of formation flying at the time of the deadly crash Though Wolk said to the AP that he was not blaming anyone  he added   He went belly up to the leader  That prevents him from gauging distance and position  The risk of collision is very high when you cannot see who you are supposed to be in formation with and that kind of join up is not permitted  Airshows are generally safe and its participants are well trained  But concern over airshow safety  particularly with older military planes  has been a growing concern for years  In 2011  11 people were killed in Reno  Nevada  when a P 51 Mustang crashed into spectators Then  in 2019  seven people were killed when a bomber crashed in Hartford  Connecticut  At the time  the National Transportation Safety Board  NTSB  said it had investigated 21 accidents since 1982 involving second world war bombers  leaving 23 dead The NTSB is investigating Saturday s crash alongside the Federal Aviation Administration Board member Michael Graham said neither of the planes involved on Saturday had voice or data recorders  making the videos online crucial to determining what happened  The NTSB may issue a preliminary report in the coming weeks  But a final report might not be available for more than a year   The AP contributed reporting
