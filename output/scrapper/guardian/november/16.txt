Republicans officially captured control of the House on Wednesday  as the Associated Press called the 218th seat for the party  The House victory ends four years of Democratic control of the lower chamber  handing Republicans the speakership and the chairmanships of key committees  while Democrats will maintain control of the Senate But the incoming Republican speaker has the unenviable task of attempting to pass legislation with a very narrow majority  where only a few defections within the party will be enough to kill a bill Republicans had hoped that a  red wave  in the midterm elections would allow them to flip dozens of House seats  giving them a much more comfortable majority  Instead  Republicans were barely about to flip the House  and Democrats may even be able to increase their Senate majority depending on the results of the Georgia runoff next month With the House and the Senate now both called  Washington is bracing for at least two years of split control of Congress  Here s what we can expect Will Congress be able to pass any bills It will be extremely difficult for Democrats to advance their legislative agenda  Republicans can use their majority power to block any bills passed by the Democratic Senate from even getting a vote on the House floor Since Joe Biden took office  some notable bills have passed the House with bipartisan support  including the infrastructure law that the president signed late last year  But the new Republican speaker will probably be hesitant to hand Biden and his party any more policy wins before the 2024 presidential race  which could result in a legislative logjam How will Republicans use their House majority Given their very narrow majority  House Republicans may have trouble advancing major legislation through the chamber  Even if they are able to pass something  the bill would almost certainly fail in the Democratic Senate  so it seems likely House Republicans will focus most of their attention on investigations and executive oversight Even before polls closed last Tuesday  House Republicans had outlined plans to launch a series of investigations into the Biden administration and members of the president s family  Republican members have expressed keen interest in investigating the administration s handling of the US troop withdrawal from Afghanistan  Biden s oversight of the US Mexican border and his son Hunter s overseas business dealings Some of the far right members of the House Republican caucus have also threatened to use their new majority to hold up must pass bills  including a debt ceiling hike  If the debt ceiling   essentially  the maximum amount the US government can borrow   is not raised  it could jeopardize the entire US economy  Some House Republicans have signaled they want to withhold support for a debt ceiling increase until they secure concessions on government spending and entitlement programs The new House Republican majority could also threaten proposals to send more military aid to Ukraine amid its war against Russia  The far right congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has said that  not another penny will go to Ukraine  once Republicans take control  alarming Ukraine s allies on Capitol Hill and abroad  With such a narrow majority  it only takes a few votes to block bills Who will replace Nancy Pelosi as House speaker That is a question that many House Republicans are asking themselves right now as well  The obvious frontrunner for the role   which oversees  manages and directs the majority party in the House   is Kevin McCarthy  the California Republican who has served as House minority leader since 2019 Kevin McCarthy speaks after he was nominated to be House speaker on Tuesday  Photograph  AFP Getty ImagesBut McCarthy has faced some dissent from within his own caucus  and it remains unclear whether he can get the 218 votes needed to become speaker  On Tuesday  the House Republican caucus easily nominated McCarthy as their speaker candidate  but 31 members cast ballots for the far right Arizona lawmaker Andy Biggs  That tally could spell disaster for McCarthy when the full floor vote is held in January  My position remains the same until further notice   no one has 218  or close  as needed    Chip Roy  a member of the far right Freedom Caucus who nominated Biggs  told the Texas Tribune on Tuesday   We have to sit down and establish the fundamental changes needed  How will Biden work with the new Republican speaker Before becoming president  Biden built a reputation in the Senate for his ability to reach across the aisle and strike compromise with his Republican colleagues  During the 2020 Democratic primary  Biden boasted about how he was even able to work with hardline segregationists such as James Eastland and Strom Thurmond  Those comments  meant to demonstrate Biden s collaborative nature  outraged many Democratic primary voters But in recent months  Biden has become increasingly vocal in his criticism of the modern Republican party  which he says is beholden to Donald Trump and hostile to democratic principles   Donald Trump and the Maga Republicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic   Biden said in September McCarthy has responded to Biden s criticism by accusing the president of having  chosen to divide  demean  and disparage his fellow Americans   simply because they disagree with his policies  So if McCarthy does manage to capture the speakership  he and Biden will not be starting off their new relationship on the best footing  When a reporter asked Biden last week about his relationship with McCarthy  the president deflected  I think he s the Republican leader  and I haven t had much of  an  occasion to talk to him   Biden replied   But I will be talking to him  What can Democrats get done without control of the House Democrats  continued control of the Senate ensures that they will still be able to approve Biden s cabinet and judicial nominations  Their Senate majority will allow Democrats to install more liberal judges in key posts  and it could give them the ability to fill another supreme court seat if one opens up in the next two years But overall  Democrats  best opportunity to enact change between now and 2024 may come down to the power of the executive  Biden has already signed more than 100 executive orders since becoming president  according to the Presidency Project at University of California Santa Barbara Biden has used executive orders to overturn some of Trump s most controversial policies  such as halting funding for construction of a wall at the US Mexican border  and to advance progressive proposals that would otherwise stall in Congress  Biden s order to provide student debt relief of up to  20 000 for millions of borrowers was celebrated by the president s progressive allies  although the policy is now facing legal challenges With Republicans now in control of the House  Biden could soon be reaching for his executive pen more frequently
