The US attorney general Merrick Garland has appointed a special counsel to determine whether Donald Trump should face criminal charges stemming from investigations into the former s president s alleged mishandling of national security materials and his role in the 6 January attack on the US Capitol The politically explosive move comes just three days after Trump announced he is running for the White House yet again  despite a disappointing Republican performance in the midterm elections  especially among candidates backed by the ex president US attorney general appoints special counsel in Trump DoJ investigations   liveRead more Based on recent developments  including the former president s announcement that he is a candidate for president in the next election  and the sitting president s stated intention to be a candidate as well  I have concluded that it is in the public interest to appoint a special counsel   Garland told a press conference on Friday Garland named Jack Smith  a veteran prosecutor and top former justice department official  to oversee the investigations into Trump as the justice department examines his role in retaining classified documents at his Mar a Lago residence and in the effort to subvert the 2020 election The appointment of a special counsel  delivered by Garland at justice department headquarters in Washington DC  reflects the sensitivity of the justice department overseeing the two most hazardous criminal investigations into Trump  and an increased possibility of charges being brought over either matter Special counsels are semi independent prosecutors who can be installed for high profile investigations when there are conflicts of interest  or the appearance of such conflicts  and provide a mechanism for the justice department to insulate itself from political considerations Trump predictably attacked the move within hours  and complained about an  appalling decision today by the egregiously corrupt Biden administration  at a black tie event Friday night after earlier telling Fox News s digital arm   It is not acceptable  It is so unfair  It is so political  The appointment of a special counsel marked an anxious development for the ex president  who was previously the subject of former special counsel Robert Mueller s investigation shortly after he took office that examined ties between his 2016 presidential campaign and Russia Trump has already spent months since the FBI seized 103 documents marked classified from Mar a Lago accusing the justice department under president Joe Biden of pursuing him for political reasons   a tension likely to become more biting as the 2024 election draws nearer But it was to allay those concerns  Garland said at the news conference  that he chose to appoint Smith to run the investigations   Appointing a special counsel at this time is the right thing to do   Garland said   The extraordinary circumstances presented here demand it  Smith  a graduate of Harvard law school  was described by current and former justice department officials as being particularly qualified for the role  given his low political profile   he is registered to vote as an Independent   and vast experience running complex criminal investigations Jack Smith has been named as special counsel to oversee investigations related to Donald Trump  Photograph  Charles Dharapak APThe former chief of the public integrity section at the justice department from 2010 to 2015  which handled government corruption probes  Smith has also acted as a special prosecutor in The Hague  adjudicating war crimes in Kosovo  as well as a prosecutor in New York  Smith helped prosecute a police brutality case that drew national attention at the US attorney s office in Brooklyn  which previously investigated Trump over possible fraud charges in a six month inquiry that ended without charges  Smith was also briefly involved in the prosecution of a CIA agent for disclosing national defense information and obstructing justice   crimes that echo potential charges against Trump  according to the warrant used by the FBI to search Mar a lago In a statement released by the justice department  Smith said   I intend to conduct the assigned investigations  and any prosecutions that may result from them  independently and in the best traditions of the Department of Justice  The pace of the investigations will not pause or flag under my watch  I will exercise independent judgment and will move the investigations forward expeditiously and thoroughly to whatever outcome the facts and the law dictate  The appointment of a special counsel could indicate that the justice department has already accumulated substantial evidence of potential criminality by Trump and his allies  said Barbara McQuade  University of Michigan law school professor and former US attorney  One thing that is significant is this suggests that they think there s a very real possibility of charges  If they were going to close the case  it would be closed by now   McQuade said But some legal experts criticized the appointment of a special counsel  saying it risked delaying the investigations   particularly the Mar a Lago documents case   and allowed Garland to duck having to make potentially bruising prosecutorial decisions  I disagree pretty strongly with the decision by attorney general Garland to seek a special counsel  I don t think it s needed under the regulations and I think it risks delaying this investigation needlessly   former acting US solicitor general Neal Katyal told MSNBC  To me  I don t really see what the case is for a special counsel  Attorney general Garland said it was because of a conflict of interest because Trump has announced that he s running  That  to me  is tantamount to regarding Donald Trump for all the maneuvers he s making   Katyal said The White House press secretary  Karine Jean Pierre  said Biden had not been given any advance notice of Garland s announcement   No  he was not aware  we were not aware   she said at a delayed press briefing   The department of justice makes decisions about criminal investigations independently  We are not involved   This article was amended on 21 November 2022 to correct some details of Jack Smith s biography
