The winner of Tuesday s midterm election runoff for one of Georgia s two seats in the US Senate will make history Raphael Warnock became the first Black senator from Georgia when he won the 2020 election runoff that helped tip the upper chamber into Democratic control  boosting the party in its capture of the House  the Senate and the White House Democrats aim to seize outright Senate majority in Georgia runoffRead moreNow  as Georgia heads for the last day of voting in the latest runoff  Warnock hopes to add another distinction   winning a full six year term in the Senate Standing in the way is another Black man  Republican challenger Herschel Walker  And whoever wins will be the first Black person elected from Georgia to a full Senate term Black voters there say the choice is stark  Warnock  the senior minister of Martin Luther King s Atlanta church  echoes traditional liberal notions of the Black experience  and Walker  a University of Georgia football icon  speaks the language of white cultural conservatism and mocks Warnock s interpretations of King  among other matters  Republicans seem to have thought they could put up Herschel Walker and confuse Black folks   said Bryce Berry  president of Georgia s Young Democrats chapter and a senior at Morehouse College  a historically Black campus from which both King and Warnock graduated Standing beneath a campus statue of King  Berry continued   We are not confused  Other Black voters raised questions about Walker s past   his false claims about his business and professional accomplishments  violence against his ex wife  reports alleging that he paid for women to have abortions while now campaigning to ban the procedure   and the way he stumbles over some public policy discussions as a candidate Republican Senate candidate Herschel Walker greets people at a campaign stop in Ellijay  Georgia  on Monday  Photograph  Alyssa Pointer ReutersSome said they believe GOP leaders are taking advantage of Walker s fame as a football star  How can you let yourself be used that way as a Black person   asked Angela Heard  a state employee from Jonesboro   I think you should be better in touch with your people instead of being a crony for someone  Even some Black conservatives who back Walker lament his candidacy as a missed opportunity to expand Republicans  reach to a key part of the electorate that remains overwhelmingly Democratic  I don t think Herschel Walker has enough relatable life experience to the average Black American for them to identify with him   said Avion Abreu  a 34 year old realtor who lives in Marietta and has supported Walker since the GOP primary campaign Warnock narrowly led Walker in the November general election  but neither crossed the 50  threshold  sending the race to a runoff on 6 December AP VoteCast  a survey of more than 3 200 voters in the state  showed that Warnock won 90  of Black voters  Walker  meanwhile  won 68  of white voters VoteCast data in the runoff from the 2020 election  which took place in early January 2021  suggested that Black voters helped fuel Warnock s victory over then Senator Kelly Loeffler  comprising almost a third of that electorate  slightly more than the Black share of the 2020 general electorate Georgia candidates  starkly divergent views on race could be key in runoffRead moreThe senator s campaign has said since then that he would have to assemble a multiracial coalition  including many moderate white voters  to win re election in a midterm election year  But it has not disputed that a strong Black turnout would be necessary regardless The Republican National Committee has answered with its own uptick in Black voter outreach  opening community centers in several heavily Black areas of the state Walker and Warnock share their stories as Black men quite differently  Warnock doesn t often use phrases like  the Black church  or  the Black experience   but infuses those institutions and ideas into his arguments The senator sometimes notes that others  like to introduce me and say I m the first Black senator from Georgia   He says Georgia voters  did an amazing thing  in 2021 but adds that it s more about the policy results from a Democratic Senate Born in 1969  he calls himself a  son of the civil rights movement  and talks about how policy affects Black Georgians  Walker  alternately  often uses humor to talk about his race to his audiences on the campaign trail that are often nearly all white  with jovial lines such as   You may have noticed I m Black  He then goes on to undermine discussions on race and racism and recast Warnock s messaging  My opponent says America ought to apologize for its whiteness   Walker says in most campaign speeches  a claim based on some of Warnock s sermons referencing institutional racism  Doyal Siddell  a 66 year old Black retiree from Douglasville  said Walker s pitch is disconnected from many Black voters   Just because you re from the community doesn t mean you understand the community   he said  At Morehouse  Berry said Walker could find some Black conservatives and nonpartisans but  has not even been to our campus  He added   He s not running a campaign that suggests he wants to represent all Georgians
