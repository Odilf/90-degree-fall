three weeks ago and was only informed last Thursday by the Heart Institute at University of Washington Medical Center that a heart had become available for him According to Holland  doctors gave him an eight hour window to reach the hospital  He proceeded to book the next flight out to Seattle However  once Holland got on his flight  he discovered that the plane had to be rerouted due to hundreds of flights at Seattle s airport being canceled as a result of the storm  I heard the pilots say welcome to Anchorage   Holland said  The window for his new heart had closed  I think I cried more that day than I have in my life and had exerted every emotion that I d never had   he said Despite the heart being given to another person on the transplant list  Holland s doctors told him that he will not be bumped down on the list because the situation was out of his control Holland told KING that he plans to fly down to Seattle in two weeks so he could be closer to the hospital once a new heart becomes available  I will be closer   there ll be no storms to stop me   he said   It would take a completely different act of God to stop me  As rescue efforts remain under way across the country
