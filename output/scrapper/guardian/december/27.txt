Donald Trump s redacted tax returns will be made public on Friday after a powerful congressional committee voted last week to release them A spokesperson for the US House of Representatives ways and means committee confirmed the timing of the release in a statement to Reuters on Tuesday The Democratic controlled committee obtained the returns last month as part of an investigation into Trump s taxes  after a lengthy court battle that ended with the US supreme court ruling in the committee s favor The move is set to ignite a political firestorm in the US  where the former president s taxes have long been a contentious matter  Trump broke with decades of presidential precedent by refusing to release his tax returns when he ran for office in 2016  and has fought to keep them under wraps The New York Times previously released extensive portions of Trump s tax returns as part of a major investigation that showed how the real estate mogul and reality TV star had suffered serious losses and engaged in extensive tax avoidance The committee released a report into its findings last week  which said the Internal Revenue Service  IRS  broke its own rules by not auditing Trump for three of the four years of his presidency The findings raised stark questions about Trump s insistence that he could not publicly release his tax returns   as other presidents routinely have done to give people a glimpse into their livelihoods   because he said his filings were under an ongoing IRS review  The committee s report also highlighted shortcomings at the IRS  which has been criticized for auditing lower income people more often than the rich House committee votes to release Trump s tax returns to the publicRead moreThe documents to be released on Friday are expected to include Trump s tax returns filed between 2015 and 2021  the years he ran for and served as president  It would be the first formal release of his financial records from his time in office A spokesperson for Trump declined to comment Trump s tax returns were not released alongside last week s report because they contain sensitive information that had to be redacted before publication  committee members said Democrats on the committee said that making the returns public was necessary to understanding the context of its report  which also included proposed legislation that would mandate the IRS to audit presidents Trump was the first presidential candidate in decades not to release his tax returns during either of his campaigns for president  He also bragged during a presidential debate that year that he was  smart  because he paid no federal taxes Democrats on the committee had only a few weeks to decide how to handle the returns once they got them  before Republicans retake control of the US House in January after winning a narrow margin of victory in November s midterm elections Reuters and the Associated Press contributed reporting
