Bryan Kohberger  the 28 year old criminology graduate student charged with first degree murder  in the macabre killings of four University of Idaho students  plans to waive an appearance in court in Pennsylvania on Tuesday where Idaho prosecutors will request his extradition  his lawyer indicated on Saturday Pennsylvania s Monroe county chief public defender  Jason LaBar  said on Saturday that he plans to tell a judge there on Tuesday that Kohberger will waive his extradition hearing there so that he can be quickly brought to Idaho to face the charges and is eager to be exonerated Kohberger was taken into custody on a  fugitive from justice warrant  at his parents  home in Effort  Pennsylvania  early on Friday morning  He is accused of murdering four young victims   Ethan Chapin  20  Madison Mogen  21  Xana Kernodle  20  and Kaylee Goncalves   on 13 November at a rented house near the university campus in Moscow  Idaho  The overall assessment is that it s a crime of passion   the mayor of Moscow  Art Bettge  said at the time  But that initial interpretation has been thrown into doubt after it was revealed that the accused man had consulted online forums seeking information from criminals on their  thoughts  emotions and actions from the beginning to end of the crime commission process  The Daily Beast reported on Saturday that Kohberger took courses by the famed forensic psychologist Katherine Ramsland  who has written 68 books including How to Catch a Killer  The Psychology of Death Investigations  and The Mind of a Murderer Police have declined to say anything about the suspect s possible motive  A Hyundai Elantra similar to a car that Idaho police had been seeking was reportedly towed from the suspect s parents house  Investigators have confirmed that a murder weapon  believed to be a long knife  has not been recovered After the suspect was arrested by police in Pennsylvania  Idaho s Latah county prosecutor  Bill Thompson  said investigators believe Kohberger broke into the students  home  with the intent to commit murder   This is not the end of this investigation  In fact  it s a new beginning   Thompson said   You all now know the name of the person who has been charged with these offenses  Kohberger is a PhD student in the department of criminal justice and criminology at Washington State University  about nine miles from the Idaho university campus  He graduated with an associate of arts degree in psychology in 2018 The arrest has brought a measure of relief to Moscow  where residents have been living in fear that a serial killer was still living in their midst  Before the suspect s arrest  theories about the killer s  or killers   identity had proliferated and authorities have come under sustained criticism for not making swifter progress Moscow police requested public help on 7 December  Within a day it was sending tips to a special FBI call center due to the volume After Kohberger s arrest  Stacy Chapin  mother of one of the four victims  said she was thankful  Chapin said she and her family were  relieved this chapter is over  because it provides a form of closure  In an interview with Fox News  Goncalves s father  Steve Goncalves  said  You can t even smile when you have this over your head  It feels like a little bit of weight has been relieved and things are on the right track  and we re moving in the right direction  In a message to students and employees at the university  the university president  Scott Green  said the arrest was  a relief for our community   Moscow  a town of 25 000 near the border with Washington state  had not seen a murder in seven years prior to 13 November  It has been a stressful time for our university  but we never lost faith that this case would be solved   But he cautioned about the  tough  months still to come for the victims  families   Let s keep them in our thoughts and prayers   Green said Much about the brutal killings remains shrouded in mystery  A police timeline of the evening revealed that two of the victims  Goncalves and Mogen  had stopped at a food truck on the way home from a bar around 2am  Chapin and Kernodle returned to the house around 1 45am Two other roommates returned home earlier  around 1am  police said  The next morning  they called friends to come to the house  believing that one of the victims found had passed out and wasn t waking up  They then called 911 Police then found two victims on the second floor  and two on the third floor  Autopsies showed that all were probably asleep when they were attacked  Each was stabbed multiple times  some had defensive wounds and there was no sign of sexual assault It remains unclear if the suspect had any connection to the victims  Former classmates recalled Kohberger as  very intelligent  but  seemingly detached   Others said he was a  bully  On Saturday  LaBar cautioned people against passing judgment on the case until a fair trial is held  The case has generated huge amounts of speculation on social media  with would be sleuths frequently trying to pin the blame for the deaths on various friends and acquaintances of the victims  Mr Kohberger has been accused of very serious crimes  but the American justice system cloaks him in a veil of innocence   LaBar wrote in a prepared statement   He should be presumed innocent until proven otherwise   not tried in the court of public opinion
