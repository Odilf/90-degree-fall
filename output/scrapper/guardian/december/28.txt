Women with restricted access to abortion in the last 40 years may have faced a higher risk of suicide  according to new research from the University of Pennsylvania Abortion restriction laws may have influenced suicide rates among reproductive aged women from 1974 to 2016  according to a study released Wednesday in Jama Psychiatry More bans and creative clinics  the future of abortion access in a post Roe USRead morePreviously  the Turnaway Study conducted by the University of California  San Francisco found that women are more likely to suffer anxiety and loss of self esteem in the short term after being denied an abortion  and are less likely to have aspirational life plans for the coming year However  according to the researchers behind Wednesday s study  this study is the first of its kind to test whether access to reproductive care is directly associated with suicide According to the study in Jama  21 states implemented at least one targeted regulation of abortion providers law from 1974 to 2016  Trap laws are measures that regulate where abortions may be provided and performed  Major medical organizations oppose Trap laws and have called them clandestine attempts to limit abortion access via costly and medically unnecessary requirements Some Trap law regulations include minimum measurements for room size and corridor width  which  according to the Guttmacher Institute   may necessitate relocation or costly changes to a clinic s physical layout and structure   By imposing regulations that sound technical and bureaucratic to a casual observer   Trap laws  avoid the kind of widespread public scrutiny that the flurry of bans passed in 2019 provoked  Typically cloaked in the language of healthcare  the regulations they impose on abortion providers are costly and  in many cases  impossible to comply with   said a report from the American Civil Liberties Union Since 1970  states have enacted more than 1 300 abortion restrictions  including limitations on abortion after six weeks   Enforcement of a Trap law was associated with a 5 81  higher annual rate of suicide than in pre enforcement years   Wednesday s study revealed  Among reproductive aged women  the weighted average annual state level suicide rate when no Trap laws were enforced was 5 5 for every 100 000 deaths  We found that the enforcement of a Trap law was related to higher suicide rates among reproductive aged women   but not to suicide rates among women of post reproductive age   the study added According to researchers behind the study  the findings are significant for several reasons  especially as suicide currently represents the second and third leading cause of death among reproductive aged women 20 to 24 and 25 to 34 respectively  Clinicians should be cognizant of the additional stresses that restricted access to reproductive care engenders as it pertains to clinical care and suicide prevention for women of reproductive age   the study said The findings also inform  ethical considerations surrounding access to abortions and reproductive care more broadly   it added  especially given the overturn of Roe v Wade earlier this year Researchers also say that the findings  contribute to a  multi level  approach for suicide prevention that relies on integrating individual  and population level factors    In the US  the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is at 800 273 8255 and online chat is also available  You can also text HOME to 741741 to connect with a crisis text line counselor  In the UK and Ireland  Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123  or email jo samaritans org or jo samaritans ie  In Australia  the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14  Other international helplines can be found at befrienders org
