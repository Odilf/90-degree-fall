A jury in New York has convicted the Trump Organization of criminal tax fraud in a stinging rebuke of the former US president s company Although Donald Trump was not personally on trial  prosecutors in the case brought by the Manhattan district attorney insisted he was fully aware of the long running scheme in which they said executives were enriched by off the books perks to make up for lower salaries  reducing the company s tax liabilities Trump Pac reportedly paid legal bills of Mar a Lago witnessesRead more This was a case about greed and cheating   Alvin Bragg  the Manhattan district attorney  said in a statement celebrating the guilty verdict   In Manhattan  no corporation is above the law  The 12 person jury in New York s state court was sent out to deliberate on Monday morning after a six week trial in which Trump Organization lawyers pinned blame for the fraud solely on the greed of longtime chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg Trump  who recently launched his 2024 campaign  assailed the investigation as part of a politically motivated  witch hunt   In a statement on Tuesday  the Trump Organization denounced the verdict  which could carry a fine of up to  1 6m  a relatively negligible sum for such a large company though it could affect future business dealings  A lawyer for the Trump Organization vowed to appeal  The notion that a company could be held responsible for an employee s actions  to benefit themselves  on their own personal tax returns is simply preposterous   the company said in a statement Weisselberg  the former close ally of Trump accepted a plea deal earlier this year admitting fraud in exchange for a five month prison sentence  Prosecutors laid out a case heavily reliant on Weisselberg s testimony The verdict represents a serious blow to Trump and his family who rose to fame as property moguls in New York but whose business practices have long shadowed in secrecy with rumors of ill doing It is also the latest in a raft of legal troubles that surround Trump  including several investigations related to his attempts to overturn the 2020 election victory of Joe Biden and his apparent removal of sensitive White House documents to his Florida resort of Mar a Lago The monthlong trial featured testimony from seven witnesses  including Weisselberg  one of Trump s most loyal lieutenants  and senior vice president and controller Jeffrey McConney  An outside accountant who spent years preparing tax returns for Trump and the company also testified  In their closing statement to the jury  prosecutors alleged that Trump had  explicitly sanctioned tax fraud  During their deliberations  jurors had zeroed in on the last count listed on the verdict sheet  falsifying business records  Jurors sent notes twice Tuesday asking for clarity on the falsifying business records charge and a reading of related testimony Weisselberg testified that he ordered accounts payable supervisor Deborah Tarasoff to delete  per Allen Weisselberg  notations from entries in Trump s personal general ledger reflecting that Trump personally paid private school tuition for Weisselberg s grandchildren First  jurors asked the judge to reread the charge and the elements they are required to find for a guilty verdict  Later  they asked to again hear Tarasoff s testimony  Tarasoff  a Trump Organization veteran  testified that Weisselberg called her into his office and told her   Go in and take my name off it  in September 2016 After resuming deliberations Tuesday  jurors sent a note asking the judge to reread three counts of falsifying business records pertaining to the creation of false W2 tax forms for Weisselberg for 2015  2016 and 2017 The case does not bring to a close the legal challenges facing Trump and his businesses   far from it  Bragg has said that a related investigation he inherited from his predecessor  district attorney Cyrus Vance Jr  is  ongoing   In that case  investigators are reportedly focused on assessing the integrity of the Trump Organization s financial statements And earlier this year  the New York state attorney general  Letitia James  brought a sweeping civil suit against the former president  three of his adult children and the Trump Organization after a lengthy investigation by her office  That suit  which is still pending  accuses Trump and his children of  staggering  fraud  alleging that they provided fraudulent statements to lenders and insurers that wildly inflated the value of his real estate holdings In a statement  James commended Bragg and his team for their successful prosecution of the former president s company   We can have no tolerance for individuals or organizations that violate our laws to line their pockets   she said  adding   This verdict sends a clear message that no one and no organization is above our laws  The legal woes have to a large extent over shadowed Trump s recent announcement of his new White House run Though Trump s campaign was launched with great fanfare from Mar a Lago  it has not set the political world alight after high profile Trump backed candidates were largely defeated in November s midterm elections Numerous rivals to Trump are now starting to emerge in the Republican party  especially Florida governor Ron DeSantis
