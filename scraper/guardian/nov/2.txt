Federal prosecutors examining Donald Trump s unauthorized retention of highly sensitive government documents at his Mar a Lago property will obtain testimony from top adviser Kash Patel after granting him limited immunity from prosecution  according to two sources familiar with the matter The immunity   a powerful tool that forces witnesses to testify on the promise that they will not be prosecuted for their statements or information derived from their statements   takes effect on 2 November and signals the importance of his testimony to the criminal investigation Trump allies saw Clarence Thomas as key to efforts to challenge 2020 electionRead moreThe justice department s interest with Patel centers on his claims that the documents found at Mar a Lago were declassified  how the documents came to end up at the property  and how Trump s aides and lawyers responded to requests for their return  the sources said The status of the documents is important because if prosecutors can prove that those seized by the FBI in August were not declassified  it could strengthen a potential obstruction case contending that Trump used the claims as an excuse for why he did not return records that had been subpoenaed Trump and advisers like Patel have claimed repeatedly since the Mar a Lago search that the seized documents were declassified  though no such evidence has emerged and Trump s lawyers have not repeated the assertions in court filings  where they could face penalties for lying But the justice department s focus on the declassification suggests federal prosecutors consider it relevant to the inquiry into Trump s retention of documents at the Florida property  as well as whether Patel himself wanted to impede or obstruct the investigation if his claims were false As Patel is a close adviser to Trump   he maintains a personal relationship with the former president   who was also appointed as one of his representatives to the National Archives  the justice department is expected to ask Patel about the circumstances behind the documents at Mar a Lago The Guardian first reported that the justice department was considering granting Patel use immunity on Wednesday morning  The immunity order  confirmed by the Wall Street Journal  was transmitted to Patel s lawyers hours later The push to secure Patel s testimony intensified after he was summoned earlier this month to testify before a federal grand jury in Washington hearing evidence about Trump s mishandling of government documents and potential obstruction when he resisted returning certain records Patel asserted his fifth amendment right against self incrimination to an array of questions  the sources said  though the basis for some was not clear  even if the documents were not declassified  making false public statements would probably not be a crime In the obstruction investigation examining Trump by the former special counsel Robert Mueller  for instance  prosecutors concluded that the former president s false statements about his campaign s ties to Russia could only be considered criminal if he made them to Congress or the FBI But after chief US district court judge Beryl Howell in Washington agreed that Patel could justifiably believe he had reason to assert the fifth  the justice department applied for an order giving him limited immunity from prosecution that was granted late last week  the sources said Trump has only doubled down in recent weeks on the claim that all of the documents in his possession were declassified  while his office has said Trump issued a standing order that records taken to the White House residence were automatically declassified  Trump also claimed to Fox News host Sean Hannity  when asked what procedures he used to declassify the documents  that presidents had the authority to declassify documents by the power of thought  Different people say different things but as I understand it  if you re the president of the United States  you can declassify just by saying it s declassified  even by thinking about it   Trump told Hannity But the justice department s willingness to grant use immunity to Patel underscores how important they consider his testimony as prosecutors continue to collect evidence against Trump through his current and former aides Prosecutors only grant immunity to witnesses as a last resort  especially in high profile cases  since it makes potentially prosecuting them in the future much more difficult  and the move requires internal approval at the highest levels of the justice department The justice department has also pressured Trump s valet  Walt Nauta  to sit for an additional interview to answer questions about how Trump instructed him to remove boxes from a storage room at Mar a Lago where documents marked classified were stashed  one of the sources said Nauta has resisted having another interview with prosecutors   on the advice of his lawyer  who also represents Patel   after they indicated they were skeptical of an initial account he gave about moving documents from the storage room and raised the prospect of charging him with obstruction
