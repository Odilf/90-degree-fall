Donald Trump repeatedly refused to disavow the outspoken antisemite and white supremacist Nick Fuentes after they spoke over dinner at his Mar a Lago resort  rejecting the advice from advisers over fears he might alienate a section of his base  two people familiar with the situation said The former US president was urged publicly and privately to denounce Fuentes in the aftermath of the dinner  which included the performer Ye  previously known as Kanye West  who has also recently been propagating antisemitic remarks But Trump eschewed making outright disavowals of Fuentes  the people said  and none of the statements from the campaign or on his Truth Social account included criticism of Fuentes  despite efforts from advisers who reached Trump over the Thanksgiving holiday Republican says Trump  empowering  extremists by having dinner with white supremacist Read moreTrump ultimately made clear that he fundamentally did not want to criticise Fuentes   a product of his dislike of confrontation and his anxiety that it might antagonise a devoted part of his base   and became more entrenched in his obstinance the more he was urged to do so Across three statements on Friday  Trump initially sought only to play down the dinner and made no mention of Fuentes or his views  before saying angrily in a post on his Truth Social website that evening that Ye  expressed no antisemitism  and  I didn t know Nick Fuentes  The line about not knowing Fuentes was the closest Trump came to acknowledging the offensive nature of the dinner  under pressure from advisers who warned him that being associated with a racist and Holocaust denier could further damage his personal brand as well as his recently launched 2024 presidential campaign But even with his ignorance of Fuentes taken at face value  the statements signal Trump will give extraordinary deference to the most fringe elements of his base   even if it means potentially losing support from more moderate Republicans who have not typically cared for his indulgence of extremism Trump has had a long history of delaying or muting criticism of white supremacy  drawing moral equivalency in 2017 between neo Nazis and counter protesters at the deadly unrest in Charlottesville  Virginia  and refusing to denounce the far right Proud Boys group at a 2020 presidential debate The halting response to Fuentes most closely mirrored his inability to condemn white supremacist groups after Charlottesville  the people said  when Trump faced intense criticism for not naming the rightwing groups in the bloodshed that ended with the death of a young woman When reached for comment  the Trump 2024 campaign said the former president had a record of combating antisemitism  including the appointment of a special envoy to combat antisemitism  and strengthening ties to Israel by recognising Israeli sovereignty in the Golan Heights The circumstances of the dinner at Mar a Lago on Tuesday  though  have been a new source of consternation for aides  who privately concede that Ye should never have been allowed to meet with Trump in the first place given his own recent antisemitic history Trump had intended to meet with Ye one on one for some time  according to a person briefed on the matter  though it was postponed around the time that Ye tweeted offensive tropes against Jews   only for it to be inexplicably rescheduled for late November The former president ended up meeting with Fuentes  who was at the unrest in Charlottesville  after he came along with Ye and a former Trump campaign aide  Karen Giorno  There was only a skeleton staff from Trump s  45 Office  at the property ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday During the dinner  the person said  Fuentes told Trump he was among the former president s supporters  but that he had been unimpressed with the 2024 campaign launch speech because it appeared stilted instead of appearing  authentic  with his ad libs and off the cuff remarks Trump  who had told Fuentes that his advisers preferred him to read speeches as scripted  turned to Ye at one point and said   He gets me  Fuentes also told Trump that he thought the former president would crush other 2024 candidates in a primary  including the Florida governor  Ron DeSantis  the person said   though Fuentes later appeared less than enthusiastic on his live stream  saying the future of the country  isn t Donald Trump  On Saturday  US president Joe Biden said  you don t want to know what I think  when asked about Trump s guests On Sunday  White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates issued a statement  saying   Bigotry  hate  and antisemitism have absolutely no place in America   including at Mar a Lago  Holocaust denial is repugnant and dangerous  and it must be forcefully condemned  And during the White House media briefing on Monday afternoon  press secretary Karine Jean Pierre said   This administration  this president totally rejects bigotry  racism  antisemitism and there is just no places for these types of vile forces in our society   We should all be condemning this  She added   When you say things like this  when you do not speak out against these kinds of poisonous and dangerous kind of remarks   that is also incredibly dangerous within itself   This article was amended on 30 November 2022  A previous version stated that Nick Fuentes  in a live stream  appeared to endorse Ron DeSantis  A reference to these remarks has been clarified
