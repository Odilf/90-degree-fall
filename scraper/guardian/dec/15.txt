A former Texas police officer was convicted of manslaughter Thursday for fatally shooting a Black woman through a rear window of her home in 2019  a rare conviction of an officer for killing someone also armed with a gun Jurors were also considering a murder charge against Aaron Dean but instead convicted him of manslaughter in the death of Atatiana Jefferson  The conviction comes more than three years after the white Fort Worth officer shot the 28 year old woman while responding to a call about an open front door Texas attorney general sought data on gender changes to state IDsRead moreDean  38  faces up to 20 years in prison on the manslaughter conviction  He had faced up to life in prison if convicted of murder  The judge told jurors Wednesday that they could also consider a manslaughter charge The Tarrant county jury returned the verdict after more than 13 hours of deliberation over two days  That followed six days of testimony and arguments in which the primary dispute was whether Dean knew Jefferson was armed when he shot her  Dean testified that he saw her weapon  prosecutors alleged the evidence showed otherwise The case was unusual for the relative speed with which  amid public outrage  the Fort Worth police department released video of the 12 October 2019 shooting and arrested Dean  He d completed the police academy the year before and quit the force without speaking to investigators Since then  the case had been repeatedly postponed amid lawyerly wrangling  the terminal illness of Dean s lead attorney and the Covid 19 pandemic Dean shot Jefferson after a neighbor called a non emergency police line to report that the front door to Jefferson s home was open  She had been playing video games that night with her nephew and it emerged at trial that they left the doors open to vent smoke from hamburgers the boy burned Police body camera footage showed that Dean and a second officer who responded to the call didn t identify themselves as police at the house  Dean and Officer Carol Darch testified that they thought the house might have been burglarized and quietly moved into the fenced off backyard looking for signs of forced entry There  Dean  whose gun was drawn  fired a single shot through the window a split second after shouting at Jefferson  who was inside  to show her hands Dean testified that he had no choice but to shoot when he saw Jefferson pointing the barrel of a gun directly at him  But under questioning from prosecutors he acknowledged numerous errors  again and again conceding that actions he took before and after the shooting were  more bad police work  Darch s back was to the window when Dean shot  but she testified that he never mentioned seeing a gun before he pulled the trigger and didn t say anything about the weapon as they rushed in to search the house Dean acknowledged on the witness stand that he only said something about the gun after seeing it on the floor inside the house and that he never gave Jefferson first aid Jefferson s eight year old nephew Zion Carr was in the room with his aunt when she was shot  Zion testified that Jefferson took out her gun believing there was an intruder in the backyard Recounting the day of the killing  Zion said in court   I was confused  because I didn t know if   it was a dream and I wasn t waking up still   At one point when the defense lawyer was questioning him  he responded   I don t like talking about what happened  This kind of conviction is exceedingly rare  with few officers facing criminal charges for on duty killings  And when officers are prosecuted for murder or manslaughter  estimates suggest only 50  are found guilty Despite mass protests against police killings in 2020 and efforts at reforms  officers in the US continue to kill an average of roughly three people a day  The Washington Post s records suggest the number of police killings has continued to increase in recent years
