The supreme court has upheld California s ban on flavored tobacco products  thwarting an effort by tobacco companies to stop it from being enforced The ban was passed overwhelmingly by voters in the November midterm elections  but RJ Reynolds and other tobacco companies sought the high court s intervention to keep it from taking effect by 21 December The ban was first passed by the state legislature two years ago but it never took effect after tobacco companies gathered enough signatures to put it on the ballot  But nearly two thirds of voters approved of banning the sale of everything from cotton candy vaping juice to menthol cigarettes Supporters of the ban say the law was necessary to put a stop to a staggering rise in teen smoking  We re on the front line   the teens pushing for flavored e cigarettes banRead moreRJ Reynolds filed a federal lawsuit the day after the 8 November vote  but lower courts refused to keep the law on hold while the suit proceeded Menthol cigarettes make up about a third of the market in California  the companies said in urging the supreme court to keep them from losing so much business in the nation s largest state They argued that the authority to ban flavored products rests with the federal Food and Drug Administration  California responded that federal law comfortably allows state and local governments to decide which tobacco products are to be sold in their jurisdictions  And the state noted that the companies only went to the supreme court after spending  tens of millions of dollars  in a losing cause at the polls California will be the second state in the nation  after Massachusetts  to enact a ban prohibiting the sale of all flavored tobacco products  A number of California cities  including Los Angeles and San Diego  have already enacted their own bans  and several states have outlawed flavored vaping products  So far  no legal challenges to those bans have prevailed  but the companies have an appeal pending at the high court in their fight with Los Angeles It s already illegal for retailers in California to sell tobacco to anyone under 21  But advocates of the ban said flavored cigarettes and vaping cartridges were still too easy for teens to obtain  The ban doesn t make it a crime to possess such products but retailers who sell them could be fined up to  250 In addition to menthol and other flavored cigarettes  the ban also prohibits the sale of flavored tobacco for vape pens  tank based systems and chewing tobacco  with exceptions made for hookahs  some cigars and loose leaf tobacco
