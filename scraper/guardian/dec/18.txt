Animal activists are calling for the US government to stop the importation of non human primates for laboratory use after documents from the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  reveal that deadly pathogenic agents  zoonotic bacteria and viruses   including one deemed to be a bioterrorism risk   entered the country with monkeys imported from Asia between 2018 and 2021 Federal investigation follows retraction of five animal experimentation papersRead moreDocuments obtained by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals  Peta  and seen exclusively by the Guardian  along with a case report by the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science  reveal that there have been six cases of Burkholderia pseudomallei identified in primates imported from Cambodia to the US The CDC did not immediately respond to a request for comment  Peta has written to the CDC urging that they immediately stop the importation of all non human primates for the protection of US residents  for the integrity of science  and for the welfare of the animals and their ecosystems B pseudomallei  endemic in south east Asia  causes melioidosis  a rare but potentially deadly disease in humans  usually caused by contact with the pathogen in soil or water  It has a mortality rate of up to 50  and B pseudomallei is  according to the CDC  a  Tier 1 select agent  with potential as a bioterrorism agent Dr Lisa Jones Engel  a Peta senior science adviser  told the Guardian   There is no indication that the CDC or research industries have been transparent with the public about these diseased monkeys  Published last week  the case report titled  Melioidosis in a Cynomolgus Macaque Imported to the United States from Cambodia  reveals that one of the macaques entered the US from Cambodia by air with 359 other macaques and was diagnosed with B pseudomallei in quarantine in Texas in January 2021  Imported non human primates  or NHPs  are held in CDC mandated quarantine for 31 days while undergoing testing for infectious diseases The macaque was euthanized due to concerns about zoonotic transmission and potential introduction of this Tier 1 select agent into the environment  The report reveals that the other 359 monkeys shipped with the infected monkey  appeared healthy at the end of the quarantine period and were released from CDC mandated quarantine  However  asymptomatic infected animals can shed B pseudomallei into the environment  Jones Engel said   Monkeys imported from Asia can harbor the Burkholderia pathogen for months  shedding the bacteria via their feces  urine  blood and saliva into the environment  The CDC knows the danger to humans and has failed to warn the public  The report confirms that the importation of animals infected by B pseudomallei could introduce the organism into the US  stating   Vigilance is critical to preventing its introduction via imported animals   At present  melioidosis is not a notifiable disease  though the report authors recommended this be considered The report identified five other macaques from Cambodia in separate shipments that were diagnosed with B pseudomallei  one during quarantine  and four others several months after they had been released from quarantine Direct transmission of the disease from animals to humans is rare but can occur  There are about 12 human cases a year in the US  mostly in travelers to Asia or northern Australia However  on 27 July 2022  the same day Peta obtained a response to a Freedom of Information Act request  the CDC issued a warning about the presence of B pseudomallei in the environment in the Mississippi Delta  This is the first time it has been detected in the soil and water in the US and came after two people in the state of Mississippi were diagnosed with melioidosis  one in 2020 and the other in 2022  Neither had traveled  and both were hospitalized but recovered The papers the CDC released in July also reveal that since 2019 the increase in imported primates has been accompanied by an increase in monkeys arriving with other zoonotic pathogens  including tuberculosis  Yersinia pseudotuberculosis  Y entercolitica  campylobacter  malaria  as well as hemorrhagic gastroenteritis   consistent with filovirus infection   Filoviruses include Ebola and Marburg viruses  Both are Tier 1 select agents Primates who were dead on arrival increased from two in 2017 to 11 in 2021  and monkeys dying in quarantine increased from 29 to 125  Primates who were ill but recovered and released rose by 2 280  from five to 119 in 2021  and overall mortality increased from 31 to 136 over five years A veterinary adviser for Action for Primates  Dr Nedim Buyukmihci  told the Guardian   Non human primates in a free living situation are unlikely to spread disease to people  But  when they are trapped  transported or confined  they become highly distressed and can shed disease causing organisms  This data emphasize the potentially significant public health risk of transporting and using non human primates in laboratories  Long tailed macaques  natives of south east Asia  are the most heavily traded primate for use in laboratories and are now endangered in part due to the exploitation by the research industry Historically  China exported the majority of macaques to the US but ceased trading during the coronavirus pandemic  This  combined with increased demand from the research industry  has resulted in a rise in wild and farmed monkey exports from Cambodia  Mauritius  Vietnam and resumption in trade from Indonesia  Laos and the Philippines  Trappers in Indonesia were filmed inflicting violence on wild macaques during their capture In recent years  the number of macaques exported from Cambodia to the USA has more than tripled from 5 851 in 2018 to 18 870 in 2021  The US is the largest importer of primates in the world and the only country to have legally imported wild macaques since 2014 Jones Engel said   The increase of diseases in the NHP is potentially a result of the increase in wild caught monkeys being inserted into the monkey farms and or exported  Long tailed macaques are often used in toxicity testing to identify adverse effects of drugs or chemicals  The restrained monkeys are dosed by injection  infusion or a tube forced into their stomach without anesthetic  Dosing can last for months or years with side effects including pain  shaking  vomiting  internal bleeding and death Proponents say there would be no production of medicines without animal research  However  the US Food and Drug Administration reports that animal tests have a 92  failure rate predicting the safety or effectiveness of pharmaceuticals in humans Cambodia has eight monkey farms  However  the industry has come under scrutiny when in November this year  federal prosecutors charged eight members of a primate smuggling ring for their role in laundering 3 000 endangered wild macaques from Cambodia to US commercial exporters  The US justice department s indictment charges two Cambodian government wildlife officials  and the owner and staffers from Vanny Bio Resources  a macaque supplier in Cambodia  The indictment includes two unnamed co conspirators in the US in Alice  Texas  and Miami The CDC has previously said Cambodia suspended its export of primates to the US  Primate experimentation in the US is part of the global wildlife trade in endangered species   Jones Engel said   It s unspeakably cruel and a substantive threat to public health  It must end   said Dr Jones Engel
