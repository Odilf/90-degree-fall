A magnitude 6 4 earthquake shook parts of northern California early on Tuesday   jolting people awake  damaging buildings and roads and leaving tens of thousands without power  Two fatalities have been linked to the quake  as a result of medical emergencies occurring during and or just following  the incident  the Humboldt county sheriff s office reported on Tuesday afternoon Centered just south west of the town of Ferndale in Humboldt county  a small community near the coast about 213 miles  343km  north west of San Francisco  the quake took place in area where tremors are not uncommon  But  locals called it the largest in recent memory  A 6 4 magnitude earthquake shook awake residents in northern California  Photograph  Anadolu Agency Getty Images It was probably the most violent earthquake we have felt in the 15 years I have lived here   Eureka resident Dan Dixon  40  said   It physically moved our bed   But  he added  his infant had slept through it Just after 2 30am local time  phones across the region buzzed to life warning residents of the rattling to come  Moments later  concrete ruptured  water pipes burst and picture frames were thrown from the walls  The state s warning system alerted roughly 3 million people across the region  according to California governor s office of emergency services  giving them at least 10 seconds to take cover      Wow  This is the aftermath of a strong magnitude 6 4 earthquake that rocked Northern California this morning Caroline Titus shared the video of their 140 year old Victorian home  She writes   This was our coffee station  Sorry for dark video  Power still out   pic twitter com 99DhGmmLag  John Carlos Estrada   Mr JCE  December 20  2022 The shaking could be felt across miles of the western coast  from south of San Jose  California  into Oregon to the north  according to surveys collected by the United States Geological Survey  There were 80 strong aftershocks that also jolted the region following the quake  some as powerful as 4 6 magnitude  according to Cal OES  and more are expected  There is a 13  chance of an aftershock larger than 5 magnitude over the next week  but the probability is constantly shifting  said USGS officials on Tuesday at a news conference Eleven people were reported as injured and the Cal OES director  Mark Ghilarducci  said officials were still assessing the total numbers of injuries  Risks that remain  as aftershocks could further rattle damaged and vulnerable infrastructure  But nonstructural elements   plates  bookshelves and TVs not anchored   are most dangerous   The potential for having a bookshelf come over and injure you is high   he said  cautioning locals to remove hazards or steer clear of them  Footage posted on social media showcased the seismic damage  as locals emerged to assess the mess left behind  Household items were strewn across the floor  backyards were filled with debris  and glass from storefront windows shattered across sidewalks  The historic Ferndale bridge  which crosses the Eel River  was cracked and the shaking also felled power lines and spouted gas leaks  causing one building to erupt in flames  The fire was quickly extinguished FERNBRIDGE EARTHQUAKE DAMAGE  Damage to Fernbridge following the 6 2 magnitude  earthquake in Humboldt County  Main road to Ferndale currently closed off by CalTrans as crews inspect for

smashed dishes   Our home is a 140 year old Victorian  The north south shaking is very evident in what fell   she tweeted   That was a big one   she said in another tweet After the earthquake  more than 70 000 customers were reported to be without power in the surrounding area  according to poweroutage us  which tracks outages across the country   nearly 75  of people across the area  Two hospitals in the area also lost power and are running on generators With a surge in winter weather settling in across the area over the coming days  there are also concerns that displaced people will face increased exposure to the cold  Local and state emergency response teams are working with the National Weather Service and the American Red Cross to prepare  Ghilarducci said  and amplifying efforts to secure access to shelter Damage assessments are ongoing and expected to continue for days as engineers and contractors examine impacted foundations  roadways  and homes  But so far  the damage seems to be less than what might be expected from the size of the temblor  according to Brian Ferguson  a spokesperson for the Cal OES Scientists have also been deployed into the field to study the damage and features of the quake  said Cynthia Pridmore  a senior engineering geologist for the USGS The county of 136 000 residents is in a region of the state that has a long history of large earthquakes  including a magnitude 7 0 in 1980 and a 6 8 in 2014  according to the California Earthquake Authority  Pridmore added that there had been more than 40 large earthquakes in the area over the last century This image courtesy of Diana McIntosh shows damage at her home in Eureka  California  on Tuesday  Photograph  Diana McIntosh AP Earthquakes are common in the region around the Mendocino triple junction   the USGS posted on an informational page about the event  noting a 6 2 magnitude quake that occurred just 20km south west exactly one year ago   In the past century  there have been at least 40 other earthquakes of M6 or larger   they said   including six earthquakes M7 or larger  within 250 km of the December 20  2022 earthquake  The earthquake also came just days after a small magnitude 3 6 earthquake struck the San Francisco Bay Area  waking up thousands of people at 3 39am Saturday and causing minor damage  That earthquake was centered in El Cerrito  about a 16 mile  25km  drive to downtown San Francisco Earthquake damage is seen at the Humboldt Creamery building in Loleta  California  Photograph  Ruth Scheider APScientists have  for years  been warning that  the big one    a catastrophic earthquake rivaling any that s been experienced so far   is due in California  But they are difficult to predict  Officials have cautioned the importance of being prepared for the event  and smaller ones like this quake  We live in earthquake country and this is another example that an earthquake can occur at any time without notice   Ghilarducci said  noting the importance of having a plan in place  When the power and key infrastructure goes out  having a store of shelf stable food and plenty of water is essential  He also encouraged more people to download the state s My Shake App  which worked to give many who were impacted more moments to drop  cover and hold  We have seen on numerous occasions that the early warning system is a very valuable tool   he said   It is something you can have and be able to have another tool in the toolbox to make your family as safe as possible
