The US justice department is seeking a top federal judge to hold Donald Trump s political office in contempt of court for not fully complying with a grand jury subpoena issued in May demanding the return of all classified documents in its possession  according to a source familiar with the matter The department in recent weeks asked the chief US district court judge for the District of Columbia  Beryl Howell  to hold Trump s office in contempt after prosecutors were unable to get the former president s lawyers to designate a custodian of records to certify all records were returned Howell has not ruled on the matter  which remains under seal  But the move  earlier reported by the Washington Post  significantly raises the stakes for Trump as he stares down a criminal investigation into unauthorized retention of national security information and obstruction of justice The issue is to do with the Trump legal team s reluctance to designate a custodian of records to certify that Trump is no longer in possession of any documents marked classified and thus in compliance with the subpoena that demanded the return of all such government records  the source said If the Trump legal team could not find someone to certify under oath that all documents bearing classified markings had been returned  the department is said to have communicated  it would seek a judicial sanction The contempt action is understood to be focused on Trump s office because the subpoena  issued on 11 May  sought the return of all documents and writings  in the custody of Donald J Trump and or the Office of Donald J Trump  bearing classification markings In response to the subpoena  the Trump lawyer Evan Corcoran conducted a search of the former president s Mar a Lago resort in Florida and identified a number of pertinent documents  and got another Trump lawyer Christina Bobb to sign a caveated certification certifying all records were returned The certification letter  though  was heavily caveated and Bobb insisted on changes to the letter drafted by Corcoran so that it ultimately read she was making the attestation  based on the information provided to me  and  to the best of my knowledge   the Guardian previously reported In the weeks after the FBI seized 103 documents marked classified when officials searched Mar a Lago on 8 August  the justice department told Trump s lawyers that they believed Trump was still in possession of additional documents  and sought a second assurance that no documents were left The department never got a second attestation and recently moved to have Trump s office held in contempt  catching by surprise Trump s legal team which had decided to take a more cooperative approach with federal prosecutors after initially trying an aggressive approach  the source said That appears to have deeply frustrated the government  which told Trump s lawyers that if they refused to designate a custodian of records to sign a sworn statement attesting that all documents marked classified had been returned  it would formally seek to hold them in contempt Should Howell hold Trump s office in contempt   a closed door hearing is scheduled at the US district court for the District of Columbia for Friday   it would probably be subject to some form of sanction until the former president s office is deemed to be in compliance with the May subpoena  Contempt is used as a coercive tactic   said Barbara McQuade  former US attorney and University of Michigan Law School professor   When it s an entity  it s often a monetary fine  The impending court battle between the justice department and Trump s lawyers comes after it emerged that a search of a storage unit in Florida holding boxes of material belonging to Trump turned up two more documents marked classified  in addition to the 103 found at Mar a Lago by the FBI It was not clear whether the department initiated the contempt proceeding before or after the two additional documents were found  The Trump legal team is understood to have turned over the two new documents as soon as they were discovered  the source said
