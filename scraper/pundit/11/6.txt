Failed New York Governor is clueless on crime   Hochul has tried to frame her slip in the polls  amidst soaring crime in the state  as being nothing more than fear mongering by Republicans   In a recent appearance  she outright dismissed the crime fears of New Yorkers saying that a few high profile crimes have  created a sense of fear in people s minds    But in addition to the rise of violent crimes in the state  the progressive drug policies of the radical left  supported by Hochul  have devastated neighborhoods overcome with drug addled zombies  Late last year  failed former New York Mayor Bill Deblasio created sanctioned  shooting galleries  where drug addicts can use any drug they want inside the safe haven sites   In 2021  Hochul signed the following into law as part of a  harm reduction  package claiming they were aimed at reducing drug related overdose deaths across New York State    911 A 2354 Relates to the Possession of Opioid Antagonists S 1795 A 533 Relates to the Establishment of a Program for the Use of Medication Assisted Treatment for Incarcerated Individuals S 2523 A 868 Decriminalizes the Possession and Sale of Hypodermic Needles and Syringes S 6044 A 128 Establishes an Online Directory for Distributers of Opioid Antagonists S 7228 A 5511 Relates to a Judicial Diversion Program for Certain Felony Offenders  The new laws   Decriminalized public possession and sale of hypodermic needles  and also lifted the cap on how many needles a pharmacy could sell Expanded the roster of crimes that drug addicts could commit to entering treatment programs and gave judges the option of mandating treatment in lieu of jail time Decriminalized  opioid antagonists  like Narcan that reverse opioid overdoses Created an online directory of opioid antagonist distributors Established substance abuse recovery programs for inmates in state and correctional facilities  And now communities in New York are paying the price   The New York Post reports  The real life horror show plays out daily in the neighborhood s gritty streets where The Post witnessed dozens of raving  hunched over junkies commandeering East 126th Street   now the home of a controversial public injection site   as drug dealers hovered nearby like vultures   Others along Park Avenue down to East 114th Street have been spotted nodding out  splayed on the sidewalk  and injecting themselves in the neck or through jeans in broad daylight    I almost hope a Republican governor wins  so that way they come and knock this all out   said community developer Derrick Taitt  referring to Tuesday s general election   The Democrats have done nothing for us  Nothing    Republican candidate for Governor  Lee Zeldin  has taken the lead in the polls in the lead up to Election Day
