Dr  Angus Dalgleish  Dr  Angus Dalgleish  a renowned oncologist practicing in the UK  recently wrote an open letter to the editor in chief of the medical journal The BMJ  urging the journal to  make valid informed consent for COVID vaccination a priority topic  because cancers and other diseases are rapidly progressing among  boosted  people   Angus George Dalgleish  72  is a professor of oncology at St George s  University of London  best known for his contributions to HIV AIDS research and is one of the most sought after doctors in London    A medical oncologist is trained to treat different types of cancer using chemotherapy and other medications  such as immunotherapy and targeted therapy   Naked Emperor Substack noted that Dr  Dalgleish is a co discoverer of the CD4 receptor as the major cellular receptor for HIV  Angus is also a vaccine researcher and founded a biotech company developing cancer vaccines  As reported by RAIR Foundation   The cancer specialist of more than 30 years writes that the link between Covid vaccine and  blood clots  myocarditis  heart attacks  and strokes is now well accepted  as is the link with myelitis and neuropathy    Dr  Dalgleish sent an urgent letter to Kamran Abbasi  the editor in chief of the British Medical Journal  BMJ     Read Dr  Dalgleish s letter below   Dear Kamran Abbasi   Covid no longer needs a vaccine programme given the average age of death of Covid in the U K  is 82 and from all other causes is 81 and falling   The link with clots  myocarditis  heart attacks and strokes is now well accepted  as is the link with myelitis and neuropathy   We predicted these side effects in our June 2020 QRBD article Sorensen et al  2020  as the blast analysis revealed 79  homologies to human epitopes  especially PF4 and myelin    However  there is now another reason to halt all vaccine programmes  As a practising oncologist I am seeing people with stable disease rapidly progress after being forced to have a booster  usually so they can travel   Even within my own personal contacts I am seeing B cell based disease after the boosters  They describe being distinctly unwell a few days to weeks after the booster   one developing leukaemia  two work colleagues Non Hodgkin s lymphoma  and an old friend who has felt like he has had Long Covid since receiving his booster and who  after getting severe bone pain  has been diagnosed as having multiple metastases from a rare B cell disorder   I am experienced enough to know that these are not the coincidental anecdotes that many suggest  especially as the same pattern is being seen in Germany  Australia and the USA   The reports of innate immune suppression after mRNA for several weeks would fit  as all these patients to date have melanoma or B cell based cancers  which are very susceptible to immune control   and that is before the reports of suppressor gene suppression by mRNA in laboratory experiments   This must be aired and debated immediately  According to a recent study published on the Harvard website  there is a dramatic rise in cancer in people under 50    A study by researchers from Brigham and Women s Hospital reveals that the incidence of early onset cancers   including breast  colon  esophagus  kidney  liver  and pancreas   has dramatically increased around the world    CNN reported    A new review of cancer registry records from 44 countries found that the incidence of early onset cancers is rising rapidly for colorectal and 13 other types of cancers  many of which affect the digestive system  and this increase is happening across many middle  and high income nations   The review s authors say the upswing in younger adults in happening in part because of more sensitive testing for some cancer types  such as thyroid cancer  But testing doesn t completely account for the trend  says co authorShuji Ogino  a professor of pathology at the Harvard T H  Chan School of Public Health   Ogino says the spike is due to an unhealthy stew of risk factors that are probably working together  some which are known and others that need to be investigated   The Gateway Pundit previously reported that a case report of a pro vaccine researcher suggested mRNA vaccine might worsen lymphoma cancer  Case Report of a Pro Vaccine Researcher Suggests mRNA Vaccine Might Worsen Lymphoma Cancer
