Trump is officially the most investigated man on the planet   The Justice Department is contemplating appointing a special counsel if Trump runs for president again in 2024  According to CNN  the DOJ has brought in a  brain trust  for advice on Trump probes   Trump is expected to announce his 2024 run after the midterm elections  Since the Democrats do not have a viable candidate who can beat Trump in 2024  Joe Biden s corrupt DOJ will be Trump s biggest obstacle   In other words  Biden s DOJ will be Trump s opponent in 2024 since Biden is brain dead and virtually no one likes Kamala Harris  Another reason why Biden s DOJ is mulling a special counsel is to distance Joe Biden  potentially Trump s opponent in 2024  from the federal investigations into Trump   If Trump gets indicted by the feds  Joe Biden can put his hands up and say he had nothing to do with indicting his opponent in the 2024 election   CNN reported   As Donald Trump inches closer to launching another presidential run after the midterm election  Justice Department officials have discussed whether a Trump candidacy would create the need for a special counsel to oversee two sprawling federal investigations related to the former president  sources familiar with the matter tell CNN   The Justice Department is also staffing up its investigations with experienced prosecutors so it s ready for any decisions after the midterms  including the potential unprecedented move of indicting a former president   Indicting an active candidate for the White House would surely spark a political firestorm  And while no decision has been made about whether a special counsel might be needed in the future  DOJ officials have debated whether doing so could insulate the Justice Department from accusations that Joe Biden s administration is targeting his chief political rival  people familiar with the matter tell CNN   The Justice Department has brought in a brain trust for high level advice on the Trump investigations  according to people familiar with the moves   Top Justice officials have looked to an old guard of former Southern District of New York prosecutors  bringing into the investigations Kansas City based federal prosecutor and national security expert David Raskin  as well as David Rody  a prosecutor turned defense lawyer who previously specialized in gang and conspiracy cases and has worked extensively with government cooperators
