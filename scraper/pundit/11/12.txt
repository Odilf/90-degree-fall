premiere Sunday night at 9pm Eastern    Shame of a Nation  details the Jan  6 Committee s one sided  false political narrative and relentless pursuit against former President Trump  his family  and staff  and the Department of Justice s tactics to break the Jan  6 defendants and detainees financially and psychologically   The shameless January 6th Unselect Committee persecuted American citizens for political purposes  They must be investigated by the new Republican House of Representatives    The Democrats are using the Jan  6 defendants and detainees as pawns to paint Trump supporters as domestic terrorists and to keep President Trump out of the White House in 2024   said co executive producer Jack Thomas Smith   The Munn family before their persecution by the Biden Regime and solicitation by the January 6th Unselect Committee    Shame of a Nation  was produced by Newsmax to accurately and fairly detail not only the tragic events of Jan  6  2021  but the serious civil rights violations that occurred against many of the protesters   The film includes a careful examination of the House Jan  6 Committee and the unprecedented weaponization of the Department of Justice and the FBI for political purposes   The program includes exclusive interviews with former Trump strategist Dr  Sebastian Gorka  Jan  6 attorney Joseph D  McBride  former Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro  former DOD Chief of Staff Kash Patel  Rep  Marjorie Taylor Greene  R Ga   Rep  Greg Steube  R Fla    Walkaway Campaign Founder Brandon Straka  retired U S  Marine Corps Gunnery Sergeant

Tortorello   January prisoner Chris Quaglin with his son before his persecution by the Regime  Quaglin hasn t seen his son in over a year and a half as he still awaits trial in unconstitutional pretrial detention at DC Gitmo   Award winning filmmaker Jack Thomas Smith directed and co executive produced the film  working with his production company Fox Trail Productions and his co executive producer Mandy Del Rio   Real crimes were committed by protesters on Jan  6  Yet  in the aftermath of that day  the political party in power weaponized the Department of Justice  FBI  and other agencies   leading to unprecedented civil rights violations of U S  citizens who engaged in those protests   Marjorie Taylor Greene  one of the only Republicans to stand up for the January 6th detainee s civil rights  will appear in the Documentary in exclusive interviews    The civil rights of the Jan  6 defendants   including the ones currently being detained   are being violated  Every American has a right to a fair and speedy trial  But in many cases we re not seeing that with the J6ers   says Jack Thomas Smith   He notes that many detainees have been held in solitary confinement for prolonged periods and have not received proper medical care  citing the example of Chris Worrell being denied cancer treatment by the D C  Jail  for which the warden was held in contempt of court   Cancer patient Chris Worrell was detained for over a year in solitary confinement at DC Gitmo  denied medical services   There have been accusations of mistreatment by the guards and other inmates as well as inhumane living conditions   mold on the walls  toilets that don t work  and inedible food   as well as denial of religious services  haircuts  shaving  even fingernail trimming   DC Jail is a notorious and filthy establishment where many complaints have been filed for civil rights violations  J6 Political Prisoners languish in tiny cells behind solid doors that replace bars    Many have been denied bail   says Smith   Their due process rights are being violated with numerous hearing delays and postponements   causing mental anguish and financial hardship   forcing many to take plea deals while staring down at the possibility of 20 years in prison for obstruction of an official proceeding    The Reffitt family was torn in half when the FBI convinced teenager Jackson Reffitt to record conversations with his unknowing father and entrap him  Reffitt was sentenced to 7 years in prison  Reffitt did not enter the Capitol   In addition  Smith asserts  the Jan  6 Committee has created  a one sided narrative to the public to cast former President Trump  his family  his staff  and his supporters in the worst possible light  In the process  they are making it impossible for the Jan  6 defendants to have a trial by a fair and impartial jury    The unfair and partial jury pool of Washington DC attend a  watch party  of the January 6th Unselect Committee  Various independent polls show that a DC Jury will never find a J6 Defendant not guilty  regardless of circumstance or proof of innocence   Smith adds   The Department of Justice has been politicized and weaponized    Political Prisoner Guy Reffitt weeps uncontrollably as his son Jackson testifies against him  He is consoled by a US Marshall that accompanied him to court    Shame of a Nation
