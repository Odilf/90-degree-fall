WITCHHUNT 4 0  NY Times Makes Baseless Claims Saying Biden DOJ  Investigating  2018 Recount Protests In Florida   Guest post by Roger Stone   Earlier this week   reporters  Alan Feurer and Michael Schmidt claimed that federal prosecutors were now investigating protests during the 2018 recount in the state of Florida where Governor Ron DeSantis won by just over 30 000 votes  in an article titled  January 6th Prosecutors Look At Proud Boys Links To 2018 Florida Protest   This entirely bogus story alleges that Central Florida Post Publisher Jacob Engels  a frequent Gateway Pundit contributor  and I are  under investigation  The claim is  as they said in the movie Goodfellas   a fugazi    Brenda Snipes  the Broward County Supervisor of Elections at the time  had a long history of breaking election laws  including illegally destroying ballots  Progressive Democrat Tim Canova  who ran against Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz in the Democrat primary exposed the illegalities of Snipes and a Florida judge agreed she had broken the law  While Snipes was ultimately removed from office by then Governor Rick Scott for violating state election laws  the 2018 recount in mid November showcased her continued pattern of breaking the law  When it was announced that a recount was triggered because of the close margins in the Governor s race  US Senate race  and the Commissioner of Agriculture race  hundreds of Floridians began peacefully protesting outside the Broward County Supervisor of Elections  beginning on November 9th  the day after the election  and continuing for several days   The Times  journalists  Alan Feurer and Michael Schmidt allege in their completely fabricated news story that I somehow directed these protests and that these peaceful and constitutionally protected demonstrations were a  dry run  for what happened in Washington DC on January 6th  In fact  I wasn t there and merely lauded the courageous and legal activism of others at the time  the New York Times never lets facts get in the way of a juicy bit of  clickbait  that features my name and handsome visage   LOL    Yet the only violation of law in 2018 that took place was inside the Broward Board of Elections where Snipes was attempting to accept and count thousands of mysteriously   found  late ballot drops   This is a lie made out of whole cloth  Yes  I knew several activists  journalists  and everyday citizens who gathered outside of the Broward County Supervisor of Elections  as is their right as Americans  And thank God they did  Jacob Engels  a Central Florida based journalist  provided real time live streams of the protests and investigated the almost daily revelations of improperly handled ballots along with fellow independent journalist Laura Loomer  Congressman Matt Gaetz was there too  providing leadership to the entirely legal protest   Yes  even some members of the Proud Boys and other politically inclined groups were present  Republican  Women s groups  America First groups  Bikers for Trump  and local GOP executive committee members were among the crowd   During the recount efforts  Snipes  office routinely blocked entry from GOP lawyers wanting to oversee the recount process  Ballots were found in returned rental cars at the Fort Lauderdale airport and in broom closets at local schools that were used as polling locations  On several occasions  late night ballot dumps arrived by box trucks that had visibly broken seals on the back hatch   The courts eventually mandated that GOP lawyers and election supervisors be allowed into the facility to monitor the recount   However  as the Democrats and their handmaidens in the mainstream media anticipate a massive red wave in next week s midterm elections  the New York Times has concocted the narrative that the protests in Broward County during the 2018 recount laid the groundwork and served as some kind of template for what would happen three years later on January 6th   Fugazi New York Times Reporter Michael Schmidt   The Times fugazi reporters Feurer and Schmidt claim plans were drawn up and money exchanged  and federal prosecutors were investigating the matter  Yet there were no plans  no payments  and no connection to those charged with crimes on January 6th   Both Feurer and Schmidt are shameless fabricators  It wasn t but six months ago that they claimed that because Oath Keeper Stewart Rhodes had sent a message in a  Friends of Stone  signal chat that it proved I had colluded with Rhodes to lead an insurrection on the United States Capitol on January 6th  This is of course a self imagined fantasy by both Feurer and Schmidt as I did not read or respond to Rhode s message in a group chat where dozens of people were active   Sadly  with the January 6th Committee hearings having been a total nothing burger  the Democrats still need to feed the beast in a last ditch effort to activate their voting base to stave off the impending red wave  They know that if Republicans take control of the House and Senate  we will expose their illegal kangaroo courts and the despicable smears they have levied against President Donald Trump  myself  and millions of patriotic Americans   It wasn t enough for them to put me through a sham trial overseen by an Obama appointed judge  It wasn t enough for them to smear me relentlessly over the past four years  It wasn t good enough for them to force me into bankruptcy  Thankfully  through a courageous act  President Donald J  Trump issued me a full pardon and commutation of my sentence  It is only through the support of my amazing wife Nydia  renewed faith in Jesus Christ  and support from tens of thousands of Americans who donated to my legal defense fund and family support fund that I am able to remain in the political arena fighting for President Donald Trump  the greatest president of our lifetime and greatest since Abraham Lincoln   This should be abundantly clear to anyone reading the New York Times article  They are looking for any reason to crack down on constitutionally protected free speech rights and freedom of the press for any journalists who dare to question them   Following the NYT piece  the Orlando Sentinel published a similar article zeroing in on Central Florida Post publisher Jacob Engels  parroting many of the same lies that NYT journalists Feurer and Schmidt  The headline read  Central Florida Blogger Examined By Prosecutors In Capitol Riot Probe   Interestingly enough  Mr  Engels was hours away from publishing an expose on how the Orlando Sentinel covered up for a leading Democrat candidate for congress in Central Florida  which you can read here    Engels sent me this in response to the Orlando Sentinel and New York Times hit pieces    The fact that the Biden Justice Department is now grasping at straws to make the completely lawful and legal protests outside the Broward County Supervisor of Elections during the 2018 recount a self imagined  dry run  for January 6th would be laughable  if it weren t so preposterous  Targeting a journalist like myself is not only shocking  but goes against the constitutional protections that all citizens have as it relates to free speech and the protections granted to journalists through freedom of the press    Finding upset in my work as a journalist  or disagreements with my conclusions  are in no way grounds to crack down on the rights of any American  myself included  The J6 Committee hearings were nothing more than Kabuki theater  however with Democrats sagging far behind less than one week before midterms  their base needs a boogeyman to continue their wet dreams of  interference  in the elections process     I have been through this too many times to remember  First publications like the NYT make wild claims and then those claims are recycled by the Trump America First hating media to the point that people believe them as fact   According to my sources within the Justice Department  no such investigation is underway or even exists  meaning that both Alan Feurer and Michael Schmidt have committed an egregious act of journalistic malfeasance  They should not be taken seriously for one moment  as they made it clear that they are more motivated by their addiction to anti Trump and anti America first propaganda than they are by truth   This latest round of fake news smears by the NYT and Orlando Sentinel should send a clear message to supporters of President Trump and the America First movement   the Democrats and media remain steadfast in their war against the American people and will do or say anything to hold on to power   We can change that this Tuesday  Vote like your life  your country  your right to worship  your right to question your government  and your right to exist depends on it  because it does    To help me fight this latest round of fake news smears  you can go to STONEDEFENSEFUND COM or
