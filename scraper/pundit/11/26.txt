Neoconservative war hawk John Bolton is trashing former President Donald Trump and championing Florida Governor Ron DeSantis for the White House in 2024   Trump has already announced his candidacy  while DeSantis has not     DeSantis has  had a very successful run as governor of Florida  He won re election on Nov  8 with a big majority  A lot of people look to him as the next generation candidate   Bolton said in a recent interview with The Guardian   That s one of Trump s biggest problems   his act is old and tired now    Bolton  who has seemingly never heard of a nation that he doesn t want to bomb  pointed to the midterms and said that people  just switched Trump off in their brain    There s no doubt Trump s endorsement in the primary can be very valuable to a candidate in the Republican party  But relying on that endorsement or trumpeting yourself as the Trump endorsed candidate is poisonous in the general election  So if you actually want to win elections  Trump is not the answer   Bolton said   Bolton continued   One question we asked was  do you want Trump or do you want a fresh face  I think in our last poll over 50  said they wanted a fresh face  That s only going to continue  I personally don t think Biden is going to end up running on the Democratic side and that ll have an impact as well      Even if they loved his style  loved his approach  loved his policies  loved everything about him  they don t want to lose and the fear is  given the results on Nov  8  that if he got the nomination  not only would he lose the general election  but he would take an awful lot of Republican candidates down with him   Bolton told The Guardian   Bolton was fired by President Trump in his first term  The former president blamed Bolton for bad advice and said in January 2020   If I listened to him  we would be in World War Six by now    While DeSantis has been amazing on domestic issues  his foreign policy positions remain largely unknown  and the endorsements from neocons has left some wondering if they would put America First   DeSantis has  had a very successful run as governor of Florida   Bolton said in the interview   He won re election on 8 November with a big majority  A lot of people look to him as the next generation candidate  That s one of Trump s biggest problems   his act is old and tired now
