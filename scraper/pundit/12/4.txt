Twitter continues to censor tweets by Kari Lake and other Trump Endorsed candidates in Arizona for exposing Katie Hobbs and corruption in Arizona s elections and the courts   The Gateway Pundit reported earlier that Katie Hobbs asked Twitter to silence her critics on top of running her own election and threatening to jail County Supervisors if they did not certify her corrupt election win   Data From MO vs  Biden  Now we know why crooked Katie Hobbs didn t want to debate Kari Lake  Why would she  when she ran the election  oversaw 30  of election day precinct machines breaking down  had the media in her pocket  and was working with social media platforms to silence her critics   This is corrupt and possible criminal activity   especially if she silenced her critics during her gubernatorial run  which is likely  Save America attorney and star RSBN reporter Christina Bobb noted that the following tweet from Kari Lake about corrupt Obama appointed Judge John Tuchi was censored with the retweet feature disabled   In June  I sued over the use of tabulators in my election  I alleged these machines were prone to failure  This suit was dismissed for standing  On election day  32  of the machines failed statewide  Yesterday  an Obama judge sanctioned my lawyers for bringing the suit at all     Kari Lake   KariLake  December 2  2022  The Gateway Pundit reported that Kari Lake and her attorneys were sanctioned by Obama appointed John Tuchi months after a motion was filed and just days before election contests can legally be filed   Tuchi sanctioned Lake over her lawsuit to ban the shady voting machines from being used in the 2022 election earlier this year   However  as we saw on Election Day in the Midterm Election  voting machine failures and tabulation issues led to massive and unprecedented voter disenfranchisement at the polls   The election was an uncertifiable disaster on Election Day when voting machines and printers suddenly stopped working at over 30  of voting centers the moment the polls opened  Republican voters were forced to wait in extremely long lines  turned away from the polls  or told to deposit their ballots in the questionable  box 3  for misread ballots   These issues were present ALL DAY at some locations   Because of this  despite having had only 17  of the turnout on election day  Democrats outperformed Republicans in multiple counties  which is unlikely  if not  impossible   It is unclear if the  errors  on election day were truly by accident or if the machines were hacked and programmed to do this  What a coincidence  though    The sanctions also came weeks after this election debacle occurred   This was clearly meant to discredit the attorneys and deter Lake from filing any more lawsuits to nullify the stolen Midterm Election   The Judge even admitted that this order was intended to  send a message  to those who file what he considers  baseless  lawsuits in the future   Lake told The Gateway Pundit   The order reads like the Judge wants to deter not bad faith cases but electoral challenges  Punishing counsel is a serious effort to impune the professional reputation of counsel   Read the full order here  Christina Bobb screenshotted Lake s tweet about the sanctions  asking   why is the retweet feature disabled on this tweet    Why is the retweet feature disabled on this tweet  pic twitter com YAOpMOl7EB    Christina Bobb   christina bobb  December 4  2022  This is also now happening on Elon Musk s tweets too  Musk just revealed to the world how Twitter interfered in our elections with the release of the  Twitter Files   I thought it may have been a ban on  KariLake s account  but it also happens on  elonmusk tweets  So is it me   Am I the drama         Why can t I retweet Musk and Lake  https   t co MuMVIRzm6E pic twitter com Saa8GpfDyf    Christina Bobb   christina bobb  December 4  2022  Other Twitter users also reported censorship and disabled retweet and like features on Kari Lake s page  The censored tweets include eyewitness testimony of a corrupt election  news articles about tabulation failures  and tweets about her own campaign   Tweets by Blake Masters  Abe Hamadeh  and Kari Lake War Room that were retweeted by Kari Lake before and after the rigged election were also censored It appears that Democrats and Twitter are still colluding to silence their political opponents and post election legal challenges
