Obama Judge John Tuchi in Arizona ruled in favor of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors on Thursday to sanction Kari Lake and Mark Finchem for exercising their right to petition Maricopa County   The Gateway Pundit previously reported that the corrupt Maricopa County Board of Supervisors requested sanctions against Kari Lake and Mark Finchem two months before the Arizona Primary Elections    Maricopa County is weaponizing the legal process against conservatives and so called  election deniers  to intimidate law abiding Americans  John Tuchi is the same federal judge who recently ruled that Maricopa County was justified in discriminating against TGP reporter Jordan Conradson and preventing him his First Amendment rights and access to the County s press room after another election disaster in the County   Tuchi waited six days until Wednesday afternoon  the day before Thanksgiving  to announce his ruling on the case between The Gateway Pundit and Maricopa County in Arizona   Similarly  Tuchi waited until now to sanction Lake and Finchem  seemingly to discredit any election challenges after the State certifies the corrupt Midterm next Monday   The Gateway Pundit previously reported that Kari Lake s lawsuit against Katie Hobbs to prohibit the use of electronic voting machines in the 2022 Midterm Elections was dismissed in August by Tuchi  alleging that Lake did not have the standing to bring the case   Now  he s sided with Maricopa County again against conservative plaintiffs   How do Obama judges always seem to end up overseeing cases involving conservatives and then ruling against them    The order to sanction Lake and Finchem argues that  Plaintiffs made false  misleading  and unsupported factual assertions in their FAC and MPI and that their claims for relief did not have an adequate factual or legal basis grounded in a reasonable pre filing inquiry  in violation of Rules    The background section of this order states   Broadly  Plaintiffs alleged that the electronic voting machines certified for use in Arizona  including optical scanners and ballot marking devices   BMDs    are  potentially unsecure  lack adequate audit capacity  fail to meet minimum statutory requirements  and deprive voters of the right to have their votes counted and reported in an accurate  auditable  legal  and transparent process     However  as we saw on Election Day in the Midterm Election  voting machine failures and tabulation issues led to massive and unprecedented voter disenfranchisement at the polls   The election was an uncertifiable disaster on Election Day when voting machines and printers suddenly stopped working at over 30  of voting centers the moment the polls opened  Republican voters were forced to wait in extremely long lines  turned away from the polls  or told to deposit their ballots in the questionable  box 3  for misread ballots   These issues were present ALL DAY at some locations   Because of this  despite having had only 17  of the turnout on election day  Democrats outperformed Republicans in multiple counties  which is unlikely and impossible   It is unclear if the  errors  on election day were truly by accident or if the machines were hacked or programmed to do this  What a coincidence though   The ruling came after all of this  likely to discredit the genuine problems that occurred on election day and prevent election challenges from receiving a fair hearing   Judge Tuchi even admitted that this ruling was meant to intimidate and discourage others from filing what he considers  baseless  election lawsuits in the future    Imposing sanctions in this case is not to ignore the importance of putting in place procedures to ensure that our elections are secure and reliable  It is to make clear that the Court will not condone litigants ignoring the steps that Arizona has already taken toward this end and furthering false narratives that baselessly undermine public trust at a time of increasing disinformation about  and distrust in  the democratic process  It is to send a message to those who might file similarly baseless suits in the future   the ruling states   Read the full order below   Sanctions   Lake v  Hobbs by Jordan Conradson on Scribd  This corrupt judge obviously doesn t want us to question our elections
