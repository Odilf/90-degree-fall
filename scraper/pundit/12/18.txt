The radical left long ago declared war on Christmas  traditional values  and Christianity in general   Now an infamous contestant from RuPaul s Drag Race is doubling down on the war while shoving a disgusting  anti Christmas play down America s throat   Miz Cracker  a biological male whose real name is Maxwell Eiias Heller  is staging a one   woman  show called Who s Holiday   The play mocks a prominent character from the classic Christmas tale The Grinch and the story s moral lesson   Cracker plays The Grinch s Cindy Lou and reimagines her as a  hard drinking  pill popping  experienced woman    He explained to far left gay website PinkNews Saturday why his  ungodly  show rejects family values and Jesus Christ    To say that Christmas is about traditional values or values of any kind anymore is pretty ridiculous   Christ is nowhere featured in this    In America  if you look at the way people knock down the doors of shopping centers  I think you can tell that we have separated Christmas from Christ    Cracker surprisingly makes a good point regarding the commercialization of Christmas  The combination of Corporate America s unyielding desire for maximum profits and the decline of Christianity in America has led to people forgetting the true meaning of the holiday  Lest one think Cracker actually wants traditional Christmas values to make a comeback  however  he says he desires the opposite    I think any opportunity that we have to kick down traditional family values is welcomed     The way of thinking about family is old and tired and we need to reinvent it     I think that Who s Holiday  does that  It makes fun of family and I think it talks about chosen family and talks about the friends that really matter and what it means to have them in your life  So yeah  f  k family    Cracker also makes clear he suffers from Trump Derangement Syndrome  He told PinkNews that the former president s return to the White House would show support for homophobia in America     I m already worried right now   Cracker said   I think it would be terrifying  Not just because he would be president  which is one thing  but because it would show that there is support for hatred and phobia in our country    Trump  of course  actually supports gay marriage and has backed the gay community on several occasions  But no expects liberals to actually bother with learning facts   The average American may not be interested in the culture war  but the culture war is interested in them  Winning this fight is essential for our national survival and all of us must engage
