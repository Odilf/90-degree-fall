National Public Radio had on Newt Gingrich this week and things did not go well for NPR   They obviously brought Newt on to bash Trump and Republicans but things didn t go as planned  Gingrich pushed back on the liberal narrative in real time  causing the host to stop and repeat certain questions   News Busters has a partial transcript  NPR Interview with Newt Goes Down Hilarious Path of Liberal Disbelief on 2020 Rigging  NPR interviewed Newt Gingrich for Friday s All Things Considered  ostensibly to underline how successful President Biden has been  Their headline at NPR org was  Newt Gingrich thinks the GOP needs to stop underestimating Biden   Anchor Mary Louise Kelly couldn t help but steer the car into the woods when Newt said the 2020 election was  rigged   as in Twitter censorship and Zuckerbucks    KELLY  But that has been what he has wanted to talk about   I mean  his repeated false claims about a stolen election  which I have to note you supported and talked about and spread  That did seem to fall flat with midterm voters  Is   how big a problem is that for Republicans   GINGRICH  Look  I ll be cheerful about coming back some time  and we can devote an entire interview to whether it was a rigged election   not necessarily stolen but certainly rigged  And we can start with all the Twitter information  and we can start with Zuckerberg s  415 million   KELLY  I just need to pause you there because it s not me saying this  This is dozens of courts across the U S  that have rejected claims of rigged elections   GINGRICH  No  no  They rejected claims of stolen elections  Nobody ever looked at rigging   KELLY  For the record  do you believe Joe Biden was legitimately elected president    GINGRICH  For the record  I believe that he won under the terms that were set up  and I think that the entire elite system cheated in every way they could to defeat Donald Trump   Listen below   Notice how the host keeps pressing Gingrich to say Biden s election was legitimate   Do you recall anyone in media doing that to Democrats after Trump won in 2016   Cross posted from American Lookout
