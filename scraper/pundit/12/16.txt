Elon Musk s Twitter Files part 6 was released on Friday   Journalist Matt Taibbi released part 6  dubbed Twitter  The FBI Subsidiary   The latest release from Twitter on their private communications reveals the FBI communicated regularly with the social media giant to regulate  censor  and blacklist conservative voices in America   FBI agents communicated regularly with Twitter brass and requested accounts be taken down and removed from the public forum  The Gateway Pundit was removed in February 2021   The FBI frequently recommended that content moderators look into specific tweets and take action against them if they violated misinformation policies  Many of these tweets were from users with very low follower counts who had engaged in satire or humor  The latest release also reveals that the FBI had 80 agents working  to identify alleged foreign influence and election tampering of all kinds   And to target anyone questioning the 2020 election results   7  The FBI s social media focused task force  known as FTIF  created in the wake of the 2016 election  swelled to 80 agents and corresponded with Twitter to identify alleged foreign influence and election tampering of all kinds     Matt Taibbi   mtaibbi  December 16  2022  Are Gigi And Leo Really Dating  Here s All You Need To Know Brainberries Culkin Cracks Up The Web With His Own Version Of  Home Alone  Brainberries  The FBI on Friday released a statement following the damning Twitter Files release  via FOX News    The FBI regularly engages with private sector entities to provide information specific to identified foreign malign influence actors  subversive  undeclared  covert  or criminal activities  Private sector entities independently make decisions about what  if any  action they take on their platforms and for their customers after the FBI has notified them    It was another arrogant statement that showed their utter contempt for the American public   How many of the thousands of conservative accounts that were taken down were promoting  subversive  covert or criminal activities  What utter bullshit   On Friday night Attorney Jonathan Turley weighed in on the smug response from the FBI to this explosive document release   Jonathan Turley   People still largely agree  I hope  that while the First Amendment applies to the government it also applies to agents of the government  So if the FBI uses a proxy  uses an agent like Twitter  it s still censorship  It s still a violation of the First Amendment     FBI  Twitter  The FBI response to the release of the Twitter files  Unfortunately  they still have no self awareness
