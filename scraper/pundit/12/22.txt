The rather unimpressive attorney for Maricopa County went on a wild rant in his closing remarks in the 2020 Election case with Kari Lake   This was just bizarre   Attorney Thomas Liddy gave the closing remarks for the county today after two days of evidence provided by Kari Lake s team that showed that the 2022 Election in Maricopa County was as messed up as 2020 Presidential election there   Liddy is the son of G  Gordon Liddy  one of the main characters in Watergate  Liddy s remarks were something other than poetic  They made as much sense as their arguments against the evidence from Lake s legal team that showed the election in Maricopa County never should have been certified with hundreds of thousands of ballots with no chain of custody records that appear to have been inserted into the election out of nowhere   The county had no response as well to the apparent intentional muck up of the printers and paper that led to long lines  disenfranchised voters  and likely corruption with the ballot counting and results   So when you do not have good excuses for the corruption in the county s election on election day  you end up with Thomas Liddy saying the things that he said   Liddy shared    Who goes out and tells their voters  don t vote on day 1 of early voting  day 2  day 3  all the way up to day 26 of early voting   They wait till the last second   That s political malpractice    You reap what you sow    Your honor the burden has not been met   When people come into this courtroom without evidence there should be a day of reckoning   This has been happening all over the country  your honor  and it s got to stop   And it s got to stop right now we got to get back to respecting elections because that s all we have    There s only one thing  one finger in the air  that makes us Americans  and that s we believe in choosing our own elections  our own rulers  our own governors   Watch this train wreck below   KARI LAKE TRIAL  Katie Hobbs  lawyer goes on bizarre rant during closing argument arguing it s political malpractice to tell voters to vote on Election Day and not vote early  Says Americans choose their own  rulers   Says you can t go contest an election in court after results pic twitter com 1WNWWmr4ha    Drew Hernandez   DrewHLive  December 22  2022   If the system was working the people wouldn t have felt the need to only vote on election day   If the system was working the election process on election day would have worked without any issues  but it didn t work  it was a trainwreck   It s political malpractice to put together processes and systems that work like Maricopa s election process   In America  we don t have and don t elect rulers   We hold valid  honest  and well functioning elections   We don t do what Maricopa is doing   What a trainwreck
